      <title>Retirement: Azure CDN Standard/Premium from Edgio (formerly Verizon) will be retired</title>
      <link>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?id=467688</link>
      <description>All Azure CDN from Edgio customers must migrate their workloads to&#160;Azure Front Door&#160;or other CDN services before January 15, 2025 as Edgio has advised their platform is currently scheduled to be shut down by that date. Migrate as soon as possible to avoid an imminent service shut-down.Microsoft's flagship CDN product, Azure Front Door Standard or Premium, is our recommended replacement and we encourage you to consider migrating your compatible workloads there.&#160;View the comparison&#160;between Azure Front Door and Azure CDN from Edgio. Azure Front Door compatible workloads can use&#160;these step-by-step instructions.For more details, please visit our learn page&#160;here&#160;and/or contact Microsoft Support.</description>

      <title>Generally Available: Cross-region replication in vCore-based Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB</title>
      <link>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?id=mdb-vcore-repl</link>
      <description>With new support&#160;for cross-region disaster recovery in vCore-based Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB, you can create a replica of a cluster&#160;in another region. This cluster replica is continuously updated with the data written in the primary region. In the&#160;rare case of an outage in the primary region, you can promote this replica to become the new read-write cluster. &#160;&#160; &#160;You can also use the cluster replica in another region for reading. This helps offload read operations from the primary cluster and deliver reads with lower latency to applications that are hosted closer to the other region. &#160;&#160; &#160;When the cluster replica in region B is promoted and becomes the new read-write cluster, it mirrors the original configuration by maintaining&#160;a read replica in the former primary region A. The global read-write connection string always points to the cluster available for writes. It allows uninterrupted work with the database after replica cluster promotion.&#160;&#160;Learn more.</description>

      <link>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?id=mdb-vcore-sharding</link>
      <description>You can now use up to five physical shards on your vCore-based Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB clusters. An increased number of shards&#160;in a cluster enables you to host larger workloads and get elevated performance through higher concurrency.&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;When you create a vCore-based Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB cluster, you can select from one to five shards. As before, each physical shard gets the same compute&#160;(vCore&#160;count and amount of RAM) and storage (GiB and IOPS) configuration. &#160;&#160;&#160;Using a greater number of physical shards can also help increase cluster performance for larger workloads that require multishard&#160;clusters because of better parallelization.&#160;&#160;Learn more</description>

      <description>Higher capacity&#160;storage with higher IOPS enables you to host larger workloads on your vCore-based Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB cluster. Now when you provision new clusters, you can help elevate performance by choosing from 8 TiB, 16 TiB, and 32 TiB with 16,000 IOPS, 18,000 IOPS, and 20,000 IOPS&#160;respectively. You can also scale up existing clusters using any of the new storage sizes as your workloads grow. &#160;&#160;When you combine these new options with multiple physical shards in your vCore-based Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB cluster, your large storage capacity&#160;can comfortably handle hundreds of terabytes of data.&#160;&#160;Learn more.</description>

      <link>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?id=public-preview-index-recommendations-in-azure-database-for-postgresql-flexible-server</link>
      <description>Now you can use index&#160;tuning to analyze&#160;the most resource intensive set of queries in your workload and produce&#160;recommendations of indexes that, once created, improve the performance of those queries. Index tuning also recommends indexes you can drop if they are identified as duplicates or are considered irrelevant for lack of use.&#160;&#160;&#160;The new index tuning feature builds on query store in Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server, which captures and retains&#160;a history of queries executed in your workload and the runtime statistics of those queries.&#160;&#160;&#160;Learn more.</description>

      <link>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?id=471200</link>
      <description>We have published an availability Service Level Agreement (SLA). The SLA can be found here, and will provide peace of mind for those of you running mission critical workloads on Elastic SAN.&#160;&#160;Additionally, we have enabled CRC protection&#160;to help customers maintain the integrity of their data by providing CRC32C checksum verification. If enabled on the client side, Elastic SAN supports checksum verification at the volume group level. This will cause connections that don&#8217;t&#160;have CRC32C set for both header and data digests to be rejected,&#160;to prevent accidental errors during communication or storage of data.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lastly, we are excited to announce GA of the integration of Elastic SAN with Azure VMware Solution (AVS).&#160;Azure Elastic SAN offers AVS customers an Azure deployed, fully managed, VMware certified SAN that can achieve massive scale, is easy to manage, and has redundancy built in at a low TCO. AVS customers now have options to deploy their workloads based on a variety of storage performance and reliability characteristics with Elastic SAN as the native block storage, and Azure NetApp Files for native file storage. Not every workload requires the performance of directly attached storage, and many workloads like backup and disaster recovery use cases or other capacity&#160;intensive workloads can benefit&#160;from this cost-efficient, extensible storage solution.</description>

      <link>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?id=azure-postgresql-migration-extension-in-azure-data-studio-1</link>
      <description>The Azure PostgreSQL migration extension in Azure Data Studio (ADS) will be officially retired on November 15, 2024. As part of our commitment to providing you with the most advanced and reliable tools, we are phasing out this extension in Azure Data Studio. The Azure PostgreSQL migration extension currently offers limited functionality and lacks support for the latest Azure Database for PostgreSQL SKUs, making it less effective for your migration needs. By retiring the extension in Azure Data Studio, we aim to focus on improving and supporting the tools that will offer you the most value in your migration journey.If you continue to use the Azure PostgreSQL migration extension after November 15, 2024 it will no longer be enhanced or supported, and will not have the latest security and compliance features. We encourage you to transition to the enhanced migration services available in the Azure portal as a feature of Azure Database for PostgreSQL &#8211; Flexible server or through Azure CLI. These services include pre-migration validation and are designed to better support your migration projects, ensuring a smoother and more efficient transition to Azure.</description>
