      <title>Public Preview: New graph operators in Kusto</title>
      <link>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?id=470309</link>
      <description>We are excited to announce the release of two powerful new graph operators in Kusto: graph-shortest-path&#160;and graph-mark-components.&#160;The graph-shortest-paths&#160;operator is designed to streamline the process of finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph. This operator efficiently identifies the shortest routes between a set of source nodes and a set of target nodes, returning a table with the.&#160;In addition, the graph-mark-components operator is designed to mark&#160;all connected components of a graph and assign&#160;each node with a unique component identifier.&#160;&#160;Both operators&#160;are now available in public preview, offering users the opportunity to explore and utilize these powerful tools in their graph analysis tasks. We invite you to try out these new features and experience the enhanced capabilities they bring.&#160;Learn more:&#160;Visit the documentation of graph-shortest-paths.&#160;&#160;Visit the documentation of&#160;graph-mark-components.</description>

      <title>Generally Available: Star pattern and default node identifier in Kusto</title>
      <link>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?id=470314</link>
      <description>We are announcing&#160;the general availability of two powerful new features in&#160;Kusto Graph Semantics.&#160;&#160;The star pattern&#160;allows users to express nonlinear patterns using comma-delimited sequences, making it particularly useful for describing connections where different sequences share one or more variable names of a node.&#160;Additionally, the new approach for defining the default node identifier&#160;simplifies the process of creating a graph from a tabular expression of edges. By setting a default node identifier in make-graph, it is readily available for the constraints section of the subsequent graph-match&#160;operator.&#160;These features are now generally available.Learn more:About star pattern&#160;in our documentation.&#160;About default node identifier&#160;in our documentation.&#160;Read Azure Data Explorer&#160;blog.</description>

      <title>Retirement: Azure PostgreSQL migration extension in Azure Data Studio (ADS)</title>
      <link>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?id=azure-postgresql-migration-extension-in-azure-data-studio-1</link>
      <description>The Azure PostgreSQL migration extension in Azure Data Studio (ADS) will be officially retired on November 15, 2024. As part of our commitment to providing you with the most advanced and reliable tools, we are phasing out this extension in Azure Data Studio. The Azure PostgreSQL migration extension currently offers limited functionality and lacks support for the latest Azure Database for PostgreSQL SKUs, making it less effective for your migration needs. By retiring the extension in Azure Data Studio, we aim to focus on improving and supporting the tools that will offer you the most value in your migration journey.If you continue to use the Azure PostgreSQL migration extension after November 15, 2024 it will no longer be enhanced or supported, and will not have the latest security and compliance features. We encourage you to transition to the enhanced migration services available in the Azure portal as a feature of Azure Database for PostgreSQL &#8211; Flexible server or through Azure CLI. These services include pre-migration validation and are designed to better support your migration projects, ensuring a smoother and more efficient transition to Azure.</description>

      <title>Public Preview: Azure DNS Support for DNSSEC</title>
      <link>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?id=468560</link>
      <description>Azure DNS now supports DNSSEC (Domain
Name System Security Extensions) in our azure public cloud, a significant
enhancement to our DNS services. This new feature provides an additional layer
of security to your domain names, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of
your DNS data. API, CLI and PowerShell is available today, with portal being
deployed over the next 2 weeks. For more information, please refer to our Azure DNSSEC documentation.&#160;&#160;What is DNSSEC?&#160;DNSSEC is a suite of extensions to DNS that adds security to
the domain name system. It helps protect against certain types of attacks, such
as cache poisoning and man-in-the-middle attacks, by enabling DNS responses to
be verified for authenticity. With DNSSEC, you can be confident that the DNS
responses you receive are exactly what the domain owner intended.&#160;Key Benefits of DNSSEC on Azure DNS&#160;
 Enhanced
     Security: DNSSEC helps prevent attackers from manipulating or
     poisoning DNS responses, ensuring that users are directed to the correct
     websites.&#160;
 Data
     Integrity: By signing DNS data, DNSSEC ensures that the information
     received from a DNS query has not been altered in transit.&#160;
 Trust
     and Authenticity: DNSSEC provides a chain of trust from the root DNS
     servers down to your domain, verifying the authenticity of DNS data.&#160;For detailed instructions,
please refer to our Azure DNSSEC
documentation.</description>

      <title>Public Preview: Azure SQL updates for mid-November 2024</title>
      <link>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?id=467743</link>
      <description>In&#160;mid-November 2024,&#160;the following updates and enhancements were made to Azure SQL:&#160;&#160;You can now set up a network security perimeter (NSP) in Azure SQL Database. An NSP defines a boundary around a group of platform&#160;as&#160;a&#160;service (PaaS)&#160;resources,&#160;providing implicit trust access between each resource. The perimeter enforces egress control, trusted communication between services,&#160;and visibility into PaaS-to-PaaS communication. SQL Database is one of the 16 services&#160;that support NSP.

      <link>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?id=467514</link>
      <description>Now you can use elastic&#160;clusters to horizontally&#160;scale&#160;Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server through row-based and schema-based sharding. Elastic clusters make it easy to build multitenant apps by offloading shard management and operations&#8212;such as tenant isolation, split,&#160;or online rebalancing of shards&#8212;to the service. Row-based sharding is ideal for multitenant software as a service (SaaS)&#160;deployments, as it splits tenants into rows within a cluster-distributed table, enhancing density and improving margins per tenant. By contrast, schema-based sharding suits microservices and lift-and-shift migrations of existing applications, offering more customization of schemas for each tenant.&#160;&#160;Learn more.</description>

collected by default. The new Logs Filtering feature allows for precise
filtering of both workload and system pods/containers. Additionally, the enhanced
ContainerLogV2 schema includes log level information to assess application
health with color-coded severity levels. A Grafana Dashboard is available for
visualizing log levels, log volume, rate, records, and more, empowering
in-depth analysis and real-time monitoring. These advancements provide users
with richer context and improved visibility into their workloads.&#160;&#160;To learn more and enable the Kubernetes Logs Metadata and Filtering

      <title>Generally Available: Cross-region replication in vCore-based Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB</title>
      <link>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?id=mdb-vcore-repl</link>
      <description>With new support&#160;for cross-region disaster recovery in vCore-based Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB, you can create a replica of a cluster&#160;in another region. This cluster replica is continuously updated with the data written in the primary region. In the&#160;rare case of an outage in the primary region, you can promote this replica to become the new read-write cluster. &#160;&#160; &#160;You can also use the cluster replica in another region for reading. This helps offload read operations from the primary cluster and deliver reads with lower latency to applications that are hosted closer to the other region. &#160;&#160; &#160;When the cluster replica in region B is promoted and becomes the new read-write cluster, it mirrors the original configuration by maintaining&#160;a read replica in the former primary region A. The global read-write connection string always points to the cluster available for writes. It allows uninterrupted work with the database after replica cluster promotion.&#160;&#160;Learn more.</description>
