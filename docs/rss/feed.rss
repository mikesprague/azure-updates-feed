      <title>TLS 1.2 to become the minimum TLS version for Azure Storage</title>
      <link>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?id=tls-12-to-become-the-minimum-tls-version-for-azure-storage</link>
      <description>To respond to evolving technology and regulatory standards, Azure Storage will remove support for TLS version 1.1 and 1.0, and the minimum supported version will be TLS1.2 starting November 1, 2025. TLS 1.2 is more secure and faster than older TLS versions. TLS 1.0 and 1.1 do not support modern cryptographic algorithms and cipher suites.&#160;&#160;

This change impacts existing and new storage accounts using TLS 1.0 and 1.1 in all clouds. To avoid disruptions to your applications connecting to Azure Storage, you must migrate to TLS 1.2 and remove dependencies on TLS version 1.0 and 1.1.&#160;

Azure Storage already supports TLS 1.2 which is set as the default. Customers using TLS 1.2 will not be impacted by the removal of support for TLS 1.0 and 1.1. For customers using TLS 1.0 or 1.1, to maintain your connections to Azure Storage, please update your operating systems, development libraries, frameworks, and all other solutions to their latest versions to support TLS 1.2 and update your clients to TLS 1.2 no later than Oct 31st, 2025.&#8239;&#160;

We have compiled a series of recommendations and resources to help with your migration:&#160;Navigate here for more information</description>

      <title>Generally Available: Single prefix enhancement to seamless gateway migration</title>
      <link>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?id=467620</link>
      <description>With the Gateway migration experience, customers can use the Azure Portal or PowerShell scripts to deploy a second Virtual Network Gateway within the same GatewaySubnet of the Virtual Network. During the migration phase, once initiated by the customer, Azure will transfer both the control plane and data path configurations from the existing gateway to the newly deployed one. This process will result in two operational Gateways within the same Gateway Subnet. After the migration is successfully completed, customers can remove the original Gateway, leaving the new Gateway in place for continued Private Connectivity.&#160;Previously, ExpressRoute Gateway customers needed to create a second address prefix to pass the validation stage of migrating their gateway. With this enhancement, customers can now migrate with a single prefix, eliminating the previous requirement to create a second address prefix in the Gateway. This feature is designed to support migrations with minimal downtime.To learn more, see:About migrating to an availability zone-enabled ExpressRoute virtual network gateway - Azure ExpressRoute | Microsoft LearnMigrate to an availability zone-enabled ExpressRoute virtual network gateway in Azure portal - Azure ExpressRoute | Microsoft Learn</description>

      <description>Azure Chaos Studio&#8217;s faults for Azure Kubernetes Service clusters
now work with managed identity authentication. Previously, local authentication
through the Kubernetes API server was the only supported authentication method.
To enable customers with an enhanced security posture for AKS clusters to
perform fault injection, the Version 2.2 AKS Chaos Mesh faults now also support
managed identity authentication. Customers using Version 2.1 faults will need
to enable the new capabilities and modify the relevant experiments to use the
new versions. Version 2.1 faults will be unavailable in the Chaos Studio user
interface on or after January 31, 2025, but remain runnable in experiments
until further notice. Learn more at this link: Using Microsoft Entra authentication with Chaos Studio AKS
faults.&#160;For more information about Azure Chaos Studio, see&#160;Azure Chaos Studio documentation.</description>

      <description>SeccompDefault is available in public preview as a new parameter through
custom node configuration. &#160;Secure
computing mode (seccomp) is used to restrict a container&#8217;s syscalls that can be
sent to the kernel. This establishes an extra layer of protection against
common system call vulnerabilities exploited by malicious actors and allows you to specify a
default seccomp profile for all workloads in the node. &#160;&#160;There
are two allowed values for SeccompDefault:&#160;Unconfined is the default parameter
value which does not block any syscalls.&#160;RuntimeDefault will block restricted
syscalls in the containerd seccomp profile.&#160;
&#160;The
RuntimeDefault profile allows a common set of syscalls while blocking those
that are less likely to be used or potentially unsafe in a containerized
application. This profile aims to provide a reliable set of security defaults
while maintaining the functionality of the workload.&#160;Learn more.</description>

      <title>Public Preview: Azure Front Door WebSocket</title>
      <link>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?id=467668</link>
      <description>We are announcing the public preview of WebSocket on Azure
Front Door Standard and Premium. WebSocket is enabled by default without
customer configurations on Azure Front Door.&#160;

WebSocket enables full duplex communication between a server
and a client over a long-running TCP connection. It eliminates the needs for
polling as required in HTTP, avoids some of the overhead of HTTP, and can reuse
the same TCP connection for multiple request/responses resulting in a more
efficient utilization of resources. This enables more interactive and real-time
scenarios. &#160;

WebSocket can be used for apps or websites which require
real-time updates/communications or continuous streams of data, such as chats,
dashboard, finance stock info update, GPS, online education, live streaming and
game apps.&#160;

For more details, please refer to Azure
Front Door WebSocket&#160;documentation.</description>
