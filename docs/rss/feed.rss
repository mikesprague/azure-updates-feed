      <title>Generally Available: Azure NetApp Files now supports minimum volume size of 50 GiB</title>
      <link>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?id=474560</link>
      <description>We are excited to announce&#8239;Azure NetApp Files volume enhancement with support for&#160;50&#160;GiB&#160;minimum volume sizes.Customers can now create an Azure NetApp Files volume as small as&#160;50&#160;GiB, compared to the initial minimum size of 100&#160;GiB. This enhancement is particularly beneficial for workloads that require smaller volumes, such as Kubernetes. This allows customers to right-size their storage volumes more appropriately when volume usage is between 50 GiB and 100 GiB, helping them save costs and free up space in the capacity pool.This feature is available in all Azure NetApp Files enabled regions.Learn More:What&#8217;s New</description>

      <title>Generally Available: Azure NetApp Files volume enhancement &#8211; allow the same file path for volumes in different availability zones</title>
      <link>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?id=public-preview-azure-netapp-files-volume-enhancement-allow-the-same-file-path-for-volumes-in-different-availability-zones</link>
      <description>With this enhancement, Azure NetApp Files now allows the use of the same volume mount path for two or more volumes in the same region if they are each in a different availability zone. This is great for highly available architectures using cross-zone replication that would benefit from using the same mount&#160;path&#160;for both the source and target volumes. Having a common mount&#160;path&#160;for the source and target volumes eases automation and reduces manual effort during the failover of disaster recovery events which could lead to reduced recovery time objectives and improved application and data availability.&#160;This enhancement can also be used with regular volumes not participating in cross-zone replication. This could be useful for scenarios involving host-based replication or for test/dev environments that need to have consistent mount&#160;paths. This volume enhancement applies to SMB, NFS, and dual-protocol volumes.
