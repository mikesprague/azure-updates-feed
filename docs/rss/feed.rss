      <title>Public Preview: Azure DNS Support for DNSSEC</title>
      <link>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?id=468560</link>
      <description>Azure DNS now supports DNSSEC (Domain
Name System Security Extensions) in our azure public cloud, a significant
enhancement to our DNS services. This new feature provides an additional layer
of security to your domain names, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of
your DNS data. API, CLI and PowerShell is available today, with portal being
deployed over the next 2 weeks. For more information, please refer to our Azure DNSSEC documentation.&#160;&#160;What is DNSSEC?&#160;DNSSEC is a suite of extensions to DNS that adds security to
the domain name system. It helps protect against certain types of attacks, such
as cache poisoning and man-in-the-middle attacks, by enabling DNS responses to
be verified for authenticity. With DNSSEC, you can be confident that the DNS
responses you receive are exactly what the domain owner intended.&#160;Key Benefits of DNSSEC on Azure DNS&#160;
 Enhanced
     Security: DNSSEC helps prevent attackers from manipulating or
     poisoning DNS responses, ensuring that users are directed to the correct
     websites.&#160;
 Data
     Integrity: By signing DNS data, DNSSEC ensures that the information
     received from a DNS query has not been altered in transit.&#160;
 Trust
     and Authenticity: DNSSEC provides a chain of trust from the root DNS
     servers down to your domain, verifying the authenticity of DNS data.&#160;For detailed instructions,
please refer to our Azure DNSSEC
documentation.</description>

      <title>Public Preview: Azure SQL updates for mid-November 2024</title>
      <link>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?id=467743</link>
      <description>In&#160;mid-November 2024,&#160;the following updates and enhancements were made to Azure SQL:&#160;&#160;You can now set up a network security perimeter (NSP) in Azure SQL Database. An NSP defines a boundary around a group of platform&#160;as&#160;a&#160;service (PaaS)&#160;resources,&#160;providing implicit trust access between each resource. The perimeter enforces egress control, trusted communication between services,&#160;and visibility into PaaS-to-PaaS communication. SQL Database is one of the 16 services&#160;that support NSP.

      <description>Network security perimeter allows Azure PaaS&#8239;resources&#8239;to communicate within an explicit trusted boundary.&#8239;External access can be limited based on network controls defined across all private link resources within a perimeter.&#8239; All resources inside a&#160;perimeter can communicate with any other resource within&#160;the&#160;perimeter.&#8239; Public inbound access can be approved using&#160;the&#160;network and identity attributes of the client,&#160;such as source IP addresses or subscriptions.&#160; Public outbound can be approved using fully qualified domain names of the external destinations.&#160;&#160;&#160;Learn more.</description>

      <title>Public Preview: Elastic clusters on Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server</title>
      <link>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?id=467514</link>
      <description>Now you can use elastic&#160;clusters to horizontally&#160;scale&#160;Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server through row-based and schema-based sharding. Elastic clusters make it easy to build multitenant apps by offloading shard management and operations&#8212;such as tenant isolation, split,&#160;or online rebalancing of shards&#8212;to the service. Row-based sharding is ideal for multitenant software as a service (SaaS)&#160;deployments, as it splits tenants into rows within a cluster-distributed table, enhancing density and improving margins per tenant. By contrast, schema-based sharding suits microservices and lift-and-shift migrations of existing applications, offering more customization of schemas for each tenant.&#160;&#160;Learn more.</description>

      <title>Generally Available: Kubernetes Metadata and Logs Filtering in Azure Monitor - Container Insights</title>
      <link>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?id=469519</link>
      <description>We are excited to announce the general availability of
Kubernetes Metadata and Logs Filtering in Azure Monitor &#8211; Container Insights!
This enhancement adds Kubernetes metadata to the ContainerLogsV2 schema,
including PodLabels, PodAnnotations, PodUid, Image, ImageID, ImageRepo, and
ImageTag. Users can customize metadata fields via ConfigMap, and all fields are
collected by default. The new Logs Filtering feature allows for precise
filtering of both workload and system pods/containers. Additionally, the enhanced
ContainerLogV2 schema includes log level information to assess application
health with color-coded severity levels. A Grafana Dashboard is available for
visualizing log levels, log volume, rate, records, and more, empowering
in-depth analysis and real-time monitoring. These advancements provide users
with richer context and improved visibility into their workloads.&#160;&#160;To learn more and enable the Kubernetes Logs Metadata and Filtering
experience, follow the steps here.&#160;If you have any questions or feedback on Kubernetes Logs Metadata and
Filtering, please reach out to ibraraslam@microsoft.com or fill out this survey!</description>

      <title>Generally Available: Cross-region replication in vCore-based Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB</title>
      <link>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?id=mdb-vcore-repl</link>
      <description>With new support&#160;for cross-region disaster recovery in vCore-based Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB, you can create a replica of a cluster&#160;in another region. This cluster replica is continuously updated with the data written in the primary region. In the&#160;rare case of an outage in the primary region, you can promote this replica to become the new read-write cluster. &#160;&#160; &#160;You can also use the cluster replica in another region for reading. This helps offload read operations from the primary cluster and deliver reads with lower latency to applications that are hosted closer to the other region. &#160;&#160; &#160;When the cluster replica in region B is promoted and becomes the new read-write cluster, it mirrors the original configuration by maintaining&#160;a read replica in the former primary region A. The global read-write connection string always points to the cluster available for writes. It allows uninterrupted work with the database after replica cluster promotion.&#160;&#160;Learn more.</description>

      <description>You can now use up to five physical shards on your vCore-based Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB clusters. An increased number of shards&#160;in a cluster enables you to host larger workloads and get elevated performance through higher concurrency.&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;When you create a vCore-based Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB cluster, you can select from one to five shards. As before, each physical shard gets the same compute&#160;(vCore&#160;count and amount of RAM) and storage (GiB and IOPS) configuration. &#160;&#160;&#160;Using a greater number of physical shards can also help increase cluster performance for larger workloads that require multishard&#160;clusters because of better parallelization.&#160;&#160;Learn more</description>

      <description>Higher capacity&#160;storage with higher IOPS enables you to host larger workloads on your vCore-based Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB cluster. Now when you provision new clusters, you can help elevate performance by choosing from 8 TiB, 16 TiB, and 32 TiB with 16,000 IOPS, 18,000 IOPS, and 20,000 IOPS&#160;respectively. You can also scale up existing clusters using any of the new storage sizes as your workloads grow. &#160;&#160;When you combine these new options with multiple physical shards in your vCore-based Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB cluster, your large storage capacity&#160;can comfortably handle hundreds of terabytes of data.&#160;&#160;Learn more.</description>
