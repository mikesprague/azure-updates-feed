      <title>Generally Available: Parallel Image Pulls by Default in AKS</title>
      <link>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?id=471237</link>
      <description>There
are two types of container image pulls: serialized and parallel.&#160;&#160;By default, AKS
versions earlier than 1.31 use serialized image pulls. Starting with AKS
version 1.31 preview, AKS defaults to parallel image pulls. Generally,
serialized image pulls are less performant than parallel pulls, especially when
dealing with large or numerous container images. This update helps to enhance
overall system efficiency.Learn more.</description>

      <title>Public Preview: IMDS restriction support in AKS</title>
      <link>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?id=471270</link>
      <description>Currently, all
pods on AKS nodes can access the AKS worker node's Azure Instance Metadata
Service (IMDS) endpoint.&#160;AKS now offers a
managed solution that restricts IMDS endpoint access for customer pods. Only
AKS system pods and user pods with host network can access IMDS for retrieving
information or authentication.&#160;Learn more.</description>

      <description>The AKS Communication Manager,
now in public preview, simplifies notifications for all your AKS maintenance
tasks by leveraging Azure Resource Notification and Azure Resource Graph
frameworks.&#160;&#160;It provides timely alerts on
event triggers and outcomes, allowing you to closely monitor your upgrades. In
case of maintenance failures, it notifies you with the reasons for the failure,
reducing operational hassles related to observability and follow-ups.&#160;Learn more.</description>

      <title>Public Preview: Windows GPU &#8211; Driver type selection</title>
      <link>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?id=471280</link>
      <description>AKS now supports GPU-enabled
Windows node pools, in public preview, to run compute-intensive Kubernetes
workloads. AKS specifies a default GPU driver type for each supported
GPU-enabled VM. Because workload and driver compatibility are important for
functioning GPU workloads, you can now specify the driver type for your Windows
GPU node. &#160;When creating a Windows agent
pool with GPU support, you have the option to specify the type of GPU driver
using the --driver-type flag.&#160;The available options are:&#160;GRID: For applications
requiring virtualization support.&#160;CUDA: Optimized for
computational tasks in scientific computing and data-intensive applications. &#160;&#160;This feature is currently not
supported for Linux GPU node pools.&#160;&#160;Learn more.</description>

      <description>KAITO
now supports high throughput model serving with the open-source vLLM serving
engine. In the KAITO inference workspace, you can deploy models using vLLM to
batch process incoming requests, accelerate inference, and optimize your AI
workload by default, preventing out-of-memory (OOM) errors and minimizing workload
disruptions.&#160;&#160;Learn more.</description>

      <description>The AI toolchain operator (KAITO) managed add-on is now available in the
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Visual Studio Code extension. With an intuitive
and visually engaging UI, this add-on is designed to simplify AI inference development.
Customers can enable KAITO, browse through the supported options, and choose an
open-source AI model to deploy to their AKS cluster. Once deployed, they can access model logs,
test performance, and fully engage with the model workspace directly from
VSCode.&#160;Learn more.</description>

      <link>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?id=471295</link>
      <description>With the release of Kubernetes v1.30, the Azure Disk
CSI driver has adopted the force detach capability. This feature allows the driver
to force detach zone-redundant storage (ZRS) data disks from VM nodes in a
failed zone and attach them to another VM, reducing the Recovery Time Objective
(RTO).Stateful workloads in AKS clusters can now quickly
recover from zone failures by detaching ZRS data disks from affected VM nodes
and reattaching them to new VMs.&#160;&#160;Learn more.</description>

long-term retention and immutable security. &#160;This simplifies compliance and strengthens
resilience for cloud-native applications.&#160;Customers can protect
clusters during a regional disaster recovery, store backup data for up to 10
years to meet compliance requirements, and secure backup data at an offsite
location to safeguard against ransomware threats.&#160;Learn more.</description>

Balancer. Starting with Kubernetes 1.30, you can control this behavior when
enabling the add-on by choosing if it gets a public or an internal IP.&#160;Learn more.</description>

      <title>Generally Available: Cross-region replication in vCore-based Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB</title>
      <link>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?id=mdb-vcore-repl</link>
      <description>With new support&#160;for cross-region disaster recovery in vCore-based Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB, you can create a replica of a cluster&#160;in another region. This cluster replica is continuously updated with the data written in the primary region. In the&#160;rare case of an outage in the primary region, you can promote this replica to become the new read-write cluster. &#160;&#160; &#160;You can also use the cluster replica in another region for reading. This helps offload read operations from the primary cluster and deliver reads with lower latency to applications that are hosted closer to the other region. &#160;&#160; &#160;When the cluster replica in region B is promoted and becomes the new read-write cluster, it mirrors the original configuration by maintaining&#160;a read replica in the former primary region A. The global read-write connection string always points to the cluster available for writes. It allows uninterrupted work with the database after replica cluster promotion.&#160;&#160;Learn more.</description>
