      <title>Retirement: Upcoming TLS changes for Azure Event Grid</title>
      <link>https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/?id=tls-changes-for-azure-event-grid</link>
      <description>Starting March 1, 2025, all Azure services will require using TLS 1.2 or higher. Support for TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 will end on March 1, 2025.&#160;To enhance security and provide best-in-class encryption for your data, we will enable Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 for Azure Event Grid on March 1, 2025.&#8239;&#8239;Required action&#8239;If you are using TLS 1.0 or TLS 1.1, we recommend using TLS 1.2 or higher. You can switch to TLS 1.2 today and take advantage of TLS 1.3 after March 1, 2025. If you are using Azure Event Grid topics, domains,&#8239;see&#8239;how to configure the minimum TLS version. If you&#8239;are using Azure Event Grid system topics, read the API documentation or SDK documentation for more information. If you are using Azure Event Grid namespaces you don&#8217;t need to perform any action because it&#8217;s already supporting TLS 1.2 by default.&#8239;&#8239;Once you enforce the minimum TLS version to 1.2 or TLS 1.3 in your Azure Event Grid resources, make sure publishing and delivery scenarios are not affected and events continue flowing in your test and production environments.&#8239;Help and support&#8239;If you have questions, get answers from community experts in&#8239;Microsoft Q&#38;A. &#8239;If you have a support plan and you need technical help, open the&#8239;Azure portal and select the question mark icon at the top of the page.</description>
