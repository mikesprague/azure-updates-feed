This cluster replica is continuously updated with the data written in the primary region. In the rare case of an outage in the primary region, you can promote this replica to become the new read-write cluster.     You can also use the cluster replica in another region for reading. This helps offload read operations from the primary cluster and deliver reads with lower latency to applications that are hosted closer to the other region.     When the cluster replica in region B is promoted and becomes the new read-write cluster, it mirrors the original configuration by maintaining a read replica in the former primary region A. The global read-write connection string always points to the cluster available for writes. It allows uninterrupted work with the database after replica cluster promotion.  Learn more."

The SLA can be found here, and will provide peace of mind for those of you running mission critical workloads on Elastic SAN.  Additionally, we have enabled CRC protection to help customers maintain the integrity of their data by providing CRC32C checksum verification. If enabled on the client side, Elastic SAN supports checksum verification at the volume group level. This will cause connections that don’t have CRC32C set for both header and data digests to be rejected, to prevent accidental errors during communication or storage of data.    Lastly, we are excited to announce GA of the integration of Elastic SAN with Azure VMware Solution (AVS). Azure Elastic SAN offers AVS customers an Azure deployed, fully managed, VMware certified SAN that can achieve massive scale, is easy to manage, and has redundancy built in at a low TCO. AVS customers now have options to deploy their workloads based on a variety of storage performance and reliability characteristics with Elastic SAN as the native block storage, and Azure NetApp Files for native file storage. Not every workload requires the performance of directly attached storage, and many workloads like backup and disaster recovery use cases or other capacity intensive workloads can benefit from this cost-efficient, extensible storage solution."
