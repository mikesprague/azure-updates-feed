      "description": "We are excited to announce the release of two powerful new graph operators in Kusto: graph-shortest-path and graph-mark-components. The graph-shortest-paths operator is designed to streamline the process of finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph. This operator efficiently identifies the shortest routes between a set of source nodes and a set of target nodes, returning a table with the. In addition, the graph-mark-components operator is designed to mark all connected components of a graph and assign each node with a unique component identifier.  Both operators are now available in public preview, offering users the opportunity to explore and utilize these powerful tools in their graph analysis tasks. We invite you to try out these new features and experience the enhanced capabilities they bring. Learn more: Visit the documentation of graph-shortest-paths.  Visit the documentation of graph-mark-components."

By setting a default node identifier in make-graph, it is readily available for the constraints section of the subsequent graph-match operator. These features are now generally available.Learn more:About star pattern in our documentation. About default node identifier in our documentation. Read Azure Data Explorer blog."

      "description": "The Azure PostgreSQL migration extension in Azure Data Studio (ADS) will be officially retired on November 15, 2024. As part of our commitment to providing you with the most advanced and reliable tools, we are phasing out this extension in Azure Data Studio. The Azure PostgreSQL migration extension currently offers limited functionality and lacks support for the latest Azure Database for PostgreSQL SKUs, making it less effective for your migration needs. By retiring the extension in Azure Data Studio, we aim to focus on improving and supporting the tools that will offer you the most value in your migration journey.If you continue to use the Azure PostgreSQL migration extension after November 15, 2024 it will no longer be enhanced or supported, and will not have the latest security and compliance features. We encourage you to transition to the enhanced migration services available in the Azure portal as a feature of Azure Database for PostgreSQL – Flexible server or through Azure CLI. These services include pre-migration validation and are designed to better support your migration projects, ensuring a smoother and more efficient transition to Azure."
