With Microsoft Entra ID authentication, there are two main benefits to users connecting to their virtual machines. First, it eliminates the need for local authentication mechanisms, reducing a point of attack for malicious actors.  Second, with Microsoft Entra ID authentication set as the authentication mechanism, instead of providing additional authentication to connect, users can experience a one-click sign-on into their virtual machines.Learn more about Microsoft Entra IDLearn to configure Entra ID for SSH connections"

TLS 1.0 and 1.1 do not support modern cryptographic algorithms and cipher suites.  \n\nThis change impacts existing and new storage accounts using TLS 1.0 and 1.1 in all clouds. To avoid disruptions to your applications connecting to Azure Storage, you must migrate to TLS 1.2 and remove dependencies on TLS version 1.0 and 1.1. \n\nAzure Storage already supports TLS 1.2 which is set as the default. Customers using TLS 1.2 will not be impacted by the removal of support for TLS 1.0 and 1.1. For customers using TLS 1.0 or 1.1, to maintain your connections to Azure Storage, please update your operating systems, development libraries, frameworks, and all other solutions to their latest versions to support TLS 1.2 and update your clients to TLS 1.2 no later than Oct 31st, 2025.  \n\nWe have compiled a series of recommendations and resources to help with your migration: Navigate here for more information"

      "category": "Features",
      "description": "With the Gateway migration experience, customers can use the Azure Portal or PowerShell scripts to deploy a second Virtual Network Gateway within the same GatewaySubnet of the Virtual Network. During the migration phase, once initiated by the customer, Azure will transfer both the control plane and data path configurations from the existing gateway to the newly deployed one. This process will result in two operational Gateways within the same Gateway Subnet. After the migration is successfully completed, customers can remove the original Gateway, leaving the new Gateway in place for continued Private Connectivity. Previously, ExpressRoute Gateway customers needed to create a second address prefix to pass the validation stage of migrating their gateway. With this enhancement, customers can now migrate with a single prefix, eliminating the previous requirement to create a second address prefix in the Gateway. This feature is designed to support migrations with minimal downtime.To learn more, see:About migrating to an availability zone-enabled ExpressRoute virtual network gateway - Azure ExpressRoute | Microsoft LearnMigrate to an availability zone-enabled ExpressRoute virtual network gateway in Azure portal - Azure ExpressRoute | Microsoft Learn"
