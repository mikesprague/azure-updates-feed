      "title": "Retirement: Azure PostgreSQL migration extension in Azure Data Studio (ADS)",
      "category": "Retirements",
      "description": "The Azure PostgreSQL migration extension in Azure Data Studio (ADS) will be officially retired on November 15, 2024. As part of our commitment to providing you with the most advanced and reliable tools, we are phasing out this extension in Azure Data Studio. The Azure PostgreSQL migration extension currently offers limited functionality and lacks support for the latest Azure Database for PostgreSQL SKUs, making it less effective for your migration needs. By retiring the extension in Azure Data Studio, we aim to focus on improving and supporting the tools that will offer you the most value in your migration journey. If you continue to use the Azure PostgreSQL migration extension after November 15, 2024, it will no longer be enhanced or supported, and will not have the latest security and compliance features. We encourage you to transition to the enhanced migration services available in the Azure portal as a feature of Azure Database for PostgreSQL – Flexible server or through Azure CLI. These services include pre-migration validation and are designed to better support your migration projects, ensuring a smoother and more efficient transition to Azure."

      "description": "Azure DNS now supports DNSSEC (Domain\nName System Security Extensions) in our azure public cloud, a significant\nenhancement to our DNS services. This new feature provides an additional layer\nof security to your domain names, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of\nyour DNS data. API, CLI and PowerShell is available today, with portal being\ndeployed over the next 2 weeks. For more information, please refer to our Azure DNSSEC documentation.  What is DNSSEC? DNSSEC is a suite of extensions to DNS that adds security to\nthe domain name system. It helps protect against certain types of attacks, such\nas cache poisoning and man-in-the-middle attacks, by enabling DNS responses to\nbe verified for authenticity. With DNSSEC, you can be confident that the DNS\nresponses you receive are exactly what the domain owner intended. Key Benefits of DNSSEC on Azure DNS \n Enhanced\n     Security: DNSSEC helps prevent attackers from manipulating or\n     poisoning DNS responses, ensuring that users are directed to the correct\n     websites. \n Data\n     Integrity: By signing DNS data, DNSSEC ensures that the information\n     received from a DNS query has not been altered in transit. \n Trust\n     and Authenticity: DNSSEC provides a chain of trust from the root DNS\n     servers down to your domain, verifying the authenticity of DNS data. For detailed instructions,\nplease refer to our Azure DNSSEC\ndocumentation."

Row-based sharding is ideal for multitenant software as a service (SaaS) deployments, as it splits tenants into rows within a cluster-distributed table, enhancing density and improving margins per tenant. By contrast, schema-based sharding suits microservices and lift-and-shift migrations of existing applications, offering more customization of schemas for each tenant.  Learn more."

This helps offload read operations from the primary cluster and deliver reads with lower latency to applications that are hosted closer to the other region.     When the cluster replica in region B is promoted and becomes the new read-write cluster, it mirrors the original configuration by maintaining a read replica in the former primary region A.
