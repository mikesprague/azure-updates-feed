      "category": "Features",
      "description": "With the Gateway migration experience, customers can use the Azure Portal or PowerShell scripts to deploy a second Virtual Network Gateway within the same GatewaySubnet of the Virtual Network. During the migration phase, once initiated by the customer, Azure will transfer both the control plane and data path configurations from the existing gateway to the newly deployed one. This process will result in two operational Gateways within the same Gateway Subnet. After the migration is successfully completed, customers can remove the original Gateway, leaving the new Gateway in place for continued Private Connectivity. Previously, ExpressRoute Gateway customers needed to create a second address prefix to pass the validation stage of migrating their gateway. With this enhancement, customers can now migrate with a single prefix, eliminating the previous requirement to create a second address prefix in the Gateway. This feature is designed to support migrations with minimal downtime.To learn more, see:About migrating to an availability zone-enabled ExpressRoute virtual network gateway - Azure ExpressRoute | Microsoft LearnMigrate to an availability zone-enabled ExpressRoute virtual network gateway in Azure portal - Azure ExpressRoute | Microsoft Learn"

This new feature simplifies managing complex routing behaviors by automating UDR orchestration. Through Azure Virtual Network Manager’s UDR management, users can easily set up routing configurations that define routing rules, allowing automatic deployment across virtual networks. This means users no longer need to manually create UDRs or use custom scripts—reducing errors and simplifying routing at scale.The UDR Management feature enables users to structure routing rules into collections, each associated with specific network groups, making routing configurations reusable and consistent across subnets or virtual networks. Users can implement custom routing behaviors, such as directing traffic within a hub-and-spoke topology or routing specific traffic types through Azure Firewall. UDR Management thus ensures seamless, flexible routing that adapts to network changes without manual intervention. To explore this new feature and its capabilities and its regional availability, please see the documentation."
