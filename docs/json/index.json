      "description": "Windows Server 2025 Standard and Datacenter edition server hotpatching - security updates without reboots - is ready for your evaluation in preview. This feature will be a game changer; simpler change control, shorter patch windows, easier orchestration Hotpatches are OS security updates that don’t require a reboot. It works by patching the in-memory code of running processes without the need to restart the process. This gives you benefits like: Lower workload impact with fewer reboots. Instead of 12 mandatory reboots a year you’ll now only have quarterly scheduled reboots (with the rare possibility of reboots being required in a nominal Hotpatch month). Fewer binaries mean updates download and install faster while consuming fewer disk and CPU resources. Easier patch orchestration and change control. Integrated with the optional Azure Update Manager. *Hotpatching for on-premises and multicloud Windows Server VMs is in preview, and will be no additional charge while in preview. It will require an Azure Arc connection and, once GA, will be offered by subscription. Hotpatching in Windows Server Datacenter: Azure Edition continues to be free of charge."

TLS 1.0 and 1.1 do not support modern cryptographic algorithms and cipher suites.  \n\nThis change impacts existing and new storage accounts using TLS 1.0 and 1.1 in all clouds. To avoid disruptions to your applications connecting to Azure Storage, you must migrate to TLS 1.2 and remove dependencies on TLS version 1.0 and 1.1. \n\nAzure Storage already supports TLS 1.2 which is set as the default. Customers using TLS 1.2 will not be impacted by the removal of support for TLS 1.0 and 1.1. For customers using TLS 1.0 or 1.1, to maintain your connections to Azure Storage, please update your operating systems, development libraries, frameworks, and all other solutions to their latest versions to support TLS 1.2 and update your clients to TLS 1.2 no later than Oct 31st, 2025.  \n\nWe have compiled a series of recommendations and resources to help with your migration: Navigate here for more information"

      "description": "With the Gateway migration experience, customers can use the Azure Portal or PowerShell scripts to deploy a second Virtual Network Gateway within the same GatewaySubnet of the Virtual Network. During the migration phase, once initiated by the customer, Azure will transfer both the control plane and data path configurations from the existing gateway to the newly deployed one. This process will result in two operational Gateways within the same Gateway Subnet. After the migration is successfully completed, customers can remove the original Gateway, leaving the new Gateway in place for continued Private Connectivity. Previously, ExpressRoute Gateway customers needed to create a second address prefix to pass the validation stage of migrating their gateway. With this enhancement, customers can now migrate with a single prefix, eliminating the previous requirement to create a second address prefix in the Gateway. This feature is designed to support migrations with minimal downtime.To learn more, see:About migrating to an availability zone-enabled ExpressRoute virtual network gateway - Azure ExpressRoute | Microsoft LearnMigrate to an availability zone-enabled ExpressRoute virtual network gateway in Azure portal - Azure ExpressRoute | Microsoft Learn"
