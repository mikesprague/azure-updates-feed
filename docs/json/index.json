      "description": "To respond to evolving technology and regulatory standards, Azure Storage will remove support for TLS version 1.1 and 1.0, and the minimum supported version will be TLS1.2 starting November 1, 2025. TLS 1.2 is more secure and faster than older TLS versions. TLS 1.0 and 1.1 do not support modern cryptographic algorithms and cipher suites.  \n\nThis change impacts existing and new storage accounts using TLS 1.0 and 1.1 in all clouds. To avoid disruptions to your applications connecting to Azure Storage, you must migrate to TLS 1.2 and remove dependencies on TLS version 1.0 and 1.1. \n\nAzure Storage already supports TLS 1.2 which is set as the default. Customers using TLS 1.2 will not be impacted by the removal of support for TLS 1.0 and 1.1. For customers using TLS 1.0 or 1.1, to maintain your connections to Azure Storage, please update your operating systems, development libraries, frameworks, and all other solutions to their latest versions to support TLS 1.2 and update your clients to TLS 1.2 no later than Oct 31st, 2025.  \n\nWe have compiled a series of recommendations and resources to help with your migration: Navigate here for more information"

      "category": "Features",
      "description": "With the Gateway migration experience, customers can use the Azure Portal or PowerShell scripts to deploy a second Virtual Network Gateway within the same GatewaySubnet of the Virtual Network. During the migration phase, once initiated by the customer, Azure will transfer both the control plane and data path configurations from the existing gateway to the newly deployed one. This process will result in two operational Gateways within the same Gateway Subnet. After the migration is successfully completed, customers can remove the original Gateway, leaving the new Gateway in place for continued Private Connectivity. Previously, ExpressRoute Gateway customers needed to create a second address prefix to pass the validation stage of migrating their gateway. With this enhancement, customers can now migrate with a single prefix, eliminating the previous requirement to create a second address prefix in the Gateway. This feature is designed to support migrations with minimal downtime.To learn more, see:About migrating to an availability zone-enabled ExpressRoute virtual network gateway - Azure ExpressRoute | Microsoft LearnMigrate to an availability zone-enabled ExpressRoute virtual network gateway in Azure portal - Azure ExpressRoute | Microsoft Learn"

This new feature simplifies managing complex routing behaviors by automating UDR orchestration. Through Azure Virtual Network Manager’s UDR management, users can easily set up routing configurations that define routing rules, allowing automatic deployment across virtual networks. This means users no longer need to manually create UDRs or use custom scripts—reducing errors and simplifying routing at scale.The UDR Management feature enables users to structure routing rules into collections, each associated with specific network groups, making routing configurations reusable and consistent across subnets or virtual networks. Users can implement custom routing behaviors, such as directing traffic within a hub-and-spoke topology or routing specific traffic types through Azure Firewall. UDR Management thus ensures seamless, flexible routing that adapts to network changes without manual intervention.
