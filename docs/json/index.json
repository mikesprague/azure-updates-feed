This enhancement is particularly beneficial for workloads that require smaller volumes, such as Kubernetes. This allows customers to right-size their storage volumes more appropriately when volume usage is between 50 GiB and 100 GiB, helping them save costs and free up space in the capacity pool.This feature is available in all Azure NetApp Files enabled regions.Learn More:What’s New"

      "category": "Features, Regions & Datacenters",
      "description": "With this enhancement, Azure NetApp Files now allows the use of the same volume mount path for two or more volumes in the same region if they are each in a different availability zone. This is great for highly available architectures using cross-zone replication that would benefit from using the same mount path for both the source and target volumes. Having a common mount path for the source and target volumes eases automation and reduces manual effort during the failover of disaster recovery events which could lead to reduced recovery time objectives and improved application and data availability. This enhancement can also be used with regular volumes not participating in cross-zone replication. This could be useful for scenarios involving host-based replication or for test/dev environments that need to have consistent mount paths. This volume enhancement applies to SMB, NFS, and dual-protocol volumes.\n\nTo learn more, see the links below:\n\n\n\tManage availability zone volume placement for Azure NetApp Files | Microsoft Learn\n\tSMB FAQs for Azure NetApp Files | Microsoft Learn\n\tNFS FAQs for Azure NetApp Files | Microsoft Learn"

You can switch to TLS 1.2 today and take advantage of TLS 1.3 after March 1, 2025. If you are using Azure Event Grid topics, domains, see how to configure the minimum TLS version. If you are using Azure Event Grid system topics, read the API documentation or SDK documentation for more information. If you are using Azure Event Grid namespaces you don’t need to perform any action because it’s already supporting TLS 1.2 by default.  Once you enforce the minimum TLS version to 1.2 or TLS 1.3 in your Azure Event Grid resources, make sure publishing and delivery scenarios are not affected and events continue flowing in your test and production environments. Help and support If you have questions, get answers from community experts in Microsoft Q&A.  If you have a support plan and you need technical help, open the Azure portal and select the question mark icon at the top of the page."
